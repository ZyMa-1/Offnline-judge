<p>This problem can solved by checking all numbers under sqrt(N), if N divided by number and number is prime</p>
<p>We can just divide N by number, while its possible and add number to out answer array</p>
<p>These actions need to be performed while n != 1</p>
<p>In the end just sort and print answer array</p>
<p>Total time complexity: <b>O(√n / log(√n))</b></p>
